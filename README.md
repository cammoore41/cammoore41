## Hi, I'm Cameron! 

I'm a data nerd living in Chicago, IL. I really enjoy working on projects related to my city or societal trends. In my free time, I love playing tennis at my local club or hitting my basement for some Orange Theory workouts.

### Currently working on: 
* Product/inventory analysis for my family business
* Exploring trends in outdoor dining in Chicago

### Goals for 2021:
* Learn Hadoop/Apache Spark
* Become more comfortable with Data Structures & Algorithms
* Use Github more frequently ðŸ˜‰

### Get in Touch:
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-moore312/).



### Thanks for coming by!
